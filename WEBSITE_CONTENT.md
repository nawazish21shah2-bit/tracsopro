## 📊 Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Security Company Monitoring
A security company uses TRACSOSPRO to monitor 50 guards across multiple client sites. Supervisors can see real-time locations, receive instant incident alerts, and generate comprehensive reports for clients.

### Scenario 2: Guard Check-In
A guard arrives at a client site, opens the app, and checks in with location verification. The system automatically logs the time and location, and notifies the supervisor. The guard can report incidents with photos throughout their shift.

### Scenario 3: Incident Response
A guard witnesses suspicious activity, captures photos through the app, and submits an incident report. The supervisor receives an instant notification, reviews the evidence, and can escalate to authorities if needed. The client receives a detailed report automatically.

### Scenario 4: Client Oversight
A business owner hires security services and uses TRACSOSPRO to monitor guard activities at their facility. They can see check-in times, review incident reports, and access analytics showing security coverage quality.
